        <h3>Web Servers</h3>
        <p>The purpose of a designated <strong>home page</strong> is to have one place for the file to return when a blank GET request is received, aka "/", or more broadly, to have an initial or default page users are directed to when they first visist a website.</p>
        <p>In the <strong>Network</strong> tab, you can see the file path and associated requested resources.</p>
        <p>The favicon.ico file has a status of 200 because it is a part of the index.html, which as been properly retrieved. The main.css and main.js have a status of 404 because they are not being properly retrieved, hence the "Not Found". This is because main.css and main.js do not exist, and because the client is trying to access them anyways, the status 400 is returned, indicating client error.</p>
        <p>The <strong>scheme</strong> is https, the <strong>subdomains</strong> are web and engr, the <strong>host domain</strong> is oregonstate.edu, and the <strong>resources</strong> are /~secrestc/CS290-ULA/Module-1/a1-secrestc/.</p>
